The dataset consists of 23,486 rows and 11 columns, each representing a unique customer review. Below is a detailed list of the key features available for analysis:

1. **Clothing ID:** Unique identifier for each clothing item being reviewed. This serves as a categorical variable.

2. **Age:** The age of the reviewer, represented as a positive integer. This
demographic information can provide insights into the preferences of different age groups.

3. **Title:** The title of the review provided by the customer. This text can offer a concise summary or sentiment of the review.

4. **Review Text:** The main body of the review, where customers provide detailed feedback about their experience with the product. This text is rich in sentiment and opinion.

5. **Rating:** An ordinal integer variable indicating the product score given by the customer, ranging from 1 (Worst) to 5 (Best). This serves as a measure of customer satisfaction.

6. **Recommended IND:** A binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the customer recommends the product. This is a direct indication of product satisfaction.

7. **Positive Feedback Count:** The number of other customers who found the review helpful or positive. This can reflect the perceived usefulness or popularity of the review.

8. **Division Name:** Categorical variable indicating the high-level product division to which the clothing item belongs (e.g., General, General Petite, etc.).

9. **Department Name:** Categorical variable indicating the specific department of the clothing item (e.g., Dresses, Bottoms, Tops, etc.).

10. **Class Name:** Categorical variable indicating the type or class of the clothing item (e.g., Dresses, Blouses, Pants, etc.).

11. **Cleaned Text:** A processed version of Review Text after removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing stemming, which aids in text analysis.

##**1.2 Objective**

The major goal of this analysis is to get insights into customer satisfaction and preferences for women's clothes based on evaluations posted on an E-Commerce site. By analyzing the provided data, we want to:

1. **Understanding Customer Satisfaction Factors**:
   - Determine the important aspects that influence customer evaluations and recommendations.
   - Determine how different product attributes (such as Division Name, Department Name, and Class Name) affect customer satisfaction.

2. **Forecast Product Recommendations**: - Create models that forecast whether
   customers would recommend a product based on reviews and ratings.
   - Use sentiment analysis on review texts to help forecast product suggestions and general customer sentiment.

##**1.3 Problem Statement**

To achieve the objectives outlined, the analysis will address the following specific questions:

1. **What are the most important factors influencing ratings?**
   - Determine which characteristics (such as age, product division, department, and class) are most significantly connected with better or lower ratings.
   - Identify patterns and trends in ratings across customer demographics and product categories.

2. **What Factors Influence Recommendations?**
   - Investigate the correlation between ratings and the likelihood of recommending a product.
   - Identify any other aspects that may influence a customer's recommendation of a product in addition to the rating assigned.

3. **How Can Sentiment Analysis Help Predict Recommendations?**
   - Apply sentiment analysis to the review text to obtain sentiment scores.
   - Look at the association between sentiment ratings and the recommendation indicator.
   - Use sentiment ratings as features in predictive models to improve the accuracy of recommendations.

"""### **Insights and Inferences from Sentiment Polarity Distribution**

#### **1. General Sentiment Trends**

**Observation**:
The histogram shows the distribution of sentiment polarity values across all reviews, ranging from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). The KDE curve provides a smoothed view of this distribution.

**Inference**:
- If the histogram is skewed towards the positive side (right side), this indicates that the majority of the reviews have a positive sentiment.
- If the histogram is skewed towards the negative side (left side), this indicates that the majority of the reviews have a negative sentiment.
- A balanced distribution around zero indicates a mix of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

#### **2. Peak Polarity Values**

**Observation**:
Identify the peak(s) in the KDE curve.

**Inference**:
- Peaks towards the right side (around 0.5 to 1) suggest a significant number of reviews are very positive.
- Peaks towards the left side (around -0.5 to -1) suggest a significant number of reviews are very negative.
- A peak near zero suggests many reviews have a neutral sentiment.

#### **3. Sentiment Extremes**

**Observation**:
Look at the tails of the distribution.

**Inference**:
- If there are long tails towards -1, it suggests that some reviews are extremely negative.
- If there are long tails towards 1, it suggests that some reviews are extremely positive.
- Short tails or the lack of reviews near the extremes (both -1 and 1) indicate that most reviews are moderate in sentiment.

#### **4. Central Tendency**

**Observation**:
Where the bulk of the distribution lies.

**Inference**:
- If the bulk of the distribution is centered around positive values (0 to 0.5), it indicates that most reviews are slightly positive.
- If the bulk is centered around negative values (0 to -0.5), it indicates that most reviews are slightly negative.
- A central peak around zero suggests that most reviews are neutral.

#### **5. Width of Distribution**

**Observation**:
The spread or width of the histogram and KDE curve.

**Inference**:
- A wide distribution indicates a large variation in review sentiments, suggesting mixed opinions among reviewers.
- A narrow distribution indicates that most reviews are similar in sentiment, showing consensus among reviewers.

#### **Example Inference from a Hypothetical Plot:**

- **Histogram Distribution**: The histogram is skewed to the right with a peak around 0.4.
- **KDE Curve**: The KDE curve shows a high density around 0.4 and a gradual decrease towards both extremes (-1 and 1).

**Insights**:
- Most reviews have a positive sentiment.
- The average sentiment polarity is around 0.4, indicating generally positive feedback.
- There are fewer extremely negative and extremely positive reviews, suggesting moderate positivity.
- The overall sentiment is not highly polarized, indicating a consensus towards positive feedback with some variation.
